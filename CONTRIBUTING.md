# CONTRIBUTING

## GUIDELINES

After cloning this repo open the project folder in a _text-editor_(vs code is preferable). If you don't have vs-code in your machine, [install it](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository. 
2. Commit your changes to your fork. 
3. Submit a pull request.
4. Handle any feedback before the request is merged.
5. Accept our sincere Thank You!

### Folder Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€â”€Assets
â””â”€â”€â”€Python

```
All the file you code should be created inside their respective programming language; Python folder only. Or else it will be treated as an "Invalid".

### Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd HacktoberFest-2023
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b add-john-doe
```

(The name of the branch does not need to have the word _add_ in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.)

### How to make necessary changes and commit those changes

Make changes based on what programming language code snippet you are adding.
For example : I want to write a program of a calculator in C++
PS: Make sure to add your Name and Programming name as the first two lines of the code snippet.

```python

# Python program for implementation of Selection
# Sort
import sys
A = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]

# Traverse through all array elements
for i in range(len(A)):
	
	# Find the minimum element in remaining 
	# unsorted array
	min_idx = i
	for j in range(i+1, len(A)):
		if A[min_idx] > A[j]:
			min_idx = j
			
	# Swap the found minimum element with 
	# the first element	 
	A[i], A[min_idx] = A[min_idx], A[i]

# Driver code to test above
print ("Sorted array")
for i in range(len(A)):
	print("%d" %A[i],end=" , ") 

```

Please make sure your contribution is valuable and unique programming code snippets, so that we can make a beautiful blogpost out of it :)

## Now commit these changes

If you go to the project directory and execute the command git status, you'll see there are changes.
Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add .
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Added new <Your component name>"
```

## Push changes to github

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
Now submit the pull request.
Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.
