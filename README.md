This repository holds the power of a blog-article-library which will be powerful enough 
with the active contribution of contributors.

Lets see how can it be made possible !!

_Start by setting your git machine_ [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)

## Steps to Collaborate

### Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top right corner of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

why we are doing this?
> well, you dont have access to main repo, so you create a copy of it on you personal github account

### Clone this repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
https://github.com/your-name/HacktoberFest-2023.git
```

where `your-name` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the [HacktoberFest-2023](https://github.com/janusjerom/HacktoberFest-2023.git) repository on GitHub to your computer.

Before cloning the repository you just make sure that you have changed the directory to _Desktop_ or to some other locations, To change the directory to Desktop run the following command:

```
cd Desktop
```

### Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd HacktoberFest-2023
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b add-john-doe
```

(The name of the branch does not need to have the word _add_ in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.)

### Commit your changes

Create a file, add your changes. Refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

Now, go to the project directory and execute the command git status, you'll see there are changes.
Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add .
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Added new <file-name>"
```

Replace `<file-name>` to your file name.

For example:

```
git commit -m "Prim's_Algorithm.py"
```

### Push changes to github

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

### Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
Now submit the pull request.
Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.

Now submit the pull request.
